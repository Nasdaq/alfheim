Create and maintain React component libraries with minimal fuss!

If something doesn‚Äôt work, please file an issue.

## Quick Overview

To install the dependencies, simply run:

```bash
yarn global add @alfheim/cli
```

or alternatively, if you only want to use the `create-component` feature in an existing project, run:

```bash
yarn add --dev @alfheim/cli
```

Read on to discover the available commands via the library.

## `alfheim init`

Use this command to create a new component library, fully set up to be used out of the box. When you run the command, you will be asked a series of questions to generate a library that works best according to your parameters.

### Options

When a component library is created using TypeScript, it will have the following directory structure:

```
‚ä¢ .storybook/
  ‚ä¢ addons.ts
  ‚ä¢ config.tsx
  ‚ä¢ webpack.config.js
  ‚ä¢ webpack.ts-transformers.js
  ‚ä¢ welcome.tsx
‚ä¢ src/
  ‚ä¢ index.ts
  ‚ä¢ @types/
    ‚ä¢ jest/
      ‚ä¢ index.d.ts
    ‚ä¢ markdown/
      ‚ä¢ index.d.ts
  ‚ä¢ components/
    ‚ä¢ Flex/
      ‚ä¢ index.tsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.test.tsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.styles.tsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.stories.tsx
      ‚ä¢ README.md
‚ä¢ tests/
  ‚ä¢ .eslintrc
  ‚ä¢ jest.setup.ts
  ‚ä¢ jest.transform.ts
‚ä¢ .eslintrc
‚ä¢ .gitignore -> only when --skip-git is not passed
‚ä¢ .npmignore  
‚ä¢ .travis.yml
‚ä¢ CHANGELOG.md
‚ä¢ commitlint.config.js
‚ä¢ conventional-changelog.json
‚ä¢ images.d.ts
‚ä¢ package.json
‚ä¢ README.md
‚ä¢ rollup.config.js
‚ä¢ tsconfig.build.json
‚ä¢ tsconfig.json
‚ä¢ tsconfig.test.json
```

When a component library is created using JavaScript/ES, it will have the following directory structure:

```
‚ä¢ .storybook/
  ‚ä¢ addons.js
  ‚ä¢ config.jsx
  ‚ä¢ webpack.config.js
  ‚ä¢ webpack.ts-transformers.js
  ‚ä¢ welcome.jsx
‚ä¢ src/
  ‚ä¢ index.js
  ‚ä¢ components/
    ‚ä¢ Flex/
      ‚ä¢ index.jsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.test.jsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.styles.jsx
      ‚ä¢ Flex.stories.jsx
      ‚ä¢ README.md
‚ä¢ tests/
  ‚ä¢ .eslintrc
  ‚ä¢ jest.setup.js
  ‚ä¢ jest.transform.js
‚ä¢ .eslintrc
‚ä¢ .gitignore -> only when --skip-git is not passed
‚ä¢ .npmignore  
‚ä¢ .travis.yml
‚ä¢ CHANGELOG.md
‚ä¢ commitlint.config.js
‚ä¢ conventional-changelog.json
‚ä¢ package.json
‚ä¢ README.md
‚ä¢ rollup.config.js
```

#### `--skip-install`

Pass this flag if you want to skip the installation of all dependencies and devDependencies at the end of file generation. This may be useful when debugging or doing a dry run. For most users, this option shouldn't be relevant.

#### `--skip-git`

Pass this flag when you want to skip git repo initialization and an initial commit following file generation. This is useful when running the command inside an existing project or doing a dry run.

## `alfheim create-component`

Use this command to create new components from a boilerplate. The generated files will contain a main component file, a stylesheet that uses `styled-components`, a testing file, a README, and a stories file for `Storybook`.

### Options

Each component should be passed as an argument to `alfheim create-component`. For example, to create `MyComponent` and `AnotherComponent` components and their associated files like so:

```bash
yarn alfheim create-component MyComponent AnotherComponent
```

When a component is created, it will have the following directory structure:

```
‚ä¢ src/
  ‚ä¢ components/
    ‚ä¢ MyComponent/
      ‚ä¢ index.tsx
      ‚ä¢ MyComponent.styles.tsx
      ‚ä¢ MyComponent.test.tsx
      ‚ä¢ MyComponent.stories.tsx
      ‚ä¢ README.md
```

In addition, `alfheim create-component` supports the following options:

- [`--parent <dir>` or `-p <dir>`](#--parent)
- [`--class-component` or `-c`](#--class-component)
- [`--enable-jsx` or `-e`](#--enable-jsx)
- [`--no-mount-tests`](#--no-mount-tests)
- [`--no-render-tests`](#--no-render-tests)
- [`--no-shallow-tests`](#--no-shallow-tests)

#### `--parent`

Use this when you want to nest a component(s) inside another component. The typical use case for this is when you don't intend to use the component(s) outside the scope of the parent. As such, component(s) nested inside `parent` component(s) should not be exported globally. When using this flag, the directory structure will look as follows:

```
‚ä¢ src/
  ‚ä¢ components/
    ‚ä¢ Parent/
      ‚ä¢ index.tsx
      ‚ä¢ ...
      ‚ä¢ components/
        ‚ä¢ Child/
          ‚ä¢ index.tsx
          ‚ä¢ Child.styles.tsx
          ‚ä¢ Child.test.tsx
          ‚ä¢ Child.stories.tsx
          ‚ä¢ README.md
```

#### `--class-component`

Pass this flag when you want the outputted component to be a class-based React component. By default, the value of this flag is set to `false` and it is recommended that you only use this flag when creating a component that has any of the following requirements:

- needs to access lifecycle methods (e.g. `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.)
- needs to have state
- needs to have custom methods and event handlers

Note that in many cases, you can also accomplish the above by using [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and forego the need to use a class component altogether.

#### `--enable-jsx`

By default, the styles file created will appear like this:

```typescript
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledExampleComponent = styled.div``;

export default StyledExampleComponent;
```

This may become an issue with more complex components that receive custom props, as `styled-components` simply forwards all props it receives to the DOM, potentially resulting in console error messages about unrecognized props. By using the `--enable-jsx` flag, your styled component will instead take the following appearance:

```typescript
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledExampleComponent = styled(({ ...props }) => <div {...props} />)``;

export default StyledExampleComponent;
```

Using this syntax, you can prevent the props you need in the styled-component from being passed down to the DOM by including it/them in the props destructuring.

#### `--no-mount-tests`

Use this flag to prevent the import of enzyme's `mount` method and all associated setup work. Useful when your component is very low-level and doesn't need integration testing.

#### `--no-render-tests`

Use this flag to prevent the import of enzyme's `render` method and all associated setup work. Useful when your component is very low-level and doesn't need integration testing.

#### `--no-shallow-tests`

Use this flag to prevent the import of enzyme's `shallow` method and all associated setup work. Useful when your component is very high-level and you're primarily looking to do integration testing.
